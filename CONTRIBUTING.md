## Getting started

### Issues

#### Reporting bugs or suggesting features

Before opening a new issue, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates:  
👉 https://github.com/PyleMC/Quantum/issues

If no related issue exists, open a new one using the appropriate issue template and provide as much detail as possible:
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Logs, screenshots, or stack traces (if applicable)

#### Working on an issue

Browse the issue list and look for something you’d like to work on.  
Issues are **not assigned** by default so feel free to start working on any open issue and submit a PR.

Using labels is recommended to find suitable tasks.

## Making changes

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install **Java 21** (if not)

### Development workflow

1. Create a new branch for your changes
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ````

2. Implement your changes

	* Follow the existing code style
	* Keep changes focused and minimal

## Pull Requests

When your changes are ready:

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a Pull Request against the main repository
3. Fill out the **Pull Request template** completely

### PR guidelines

* Clearly describe **what** and **why** you changed
* Link related issues using keywords (e.g. `Fixes #123`)
* Keep PRs small and focused
* Enable **“Allow maintainer edits”**
* Ensure all checks pass before requesting review

Reviewers may:

* Ask for clarifications
* Request changes
* Suggest improvements directly in the code

Please address feedback and mark conversations as resolved once fixed.
